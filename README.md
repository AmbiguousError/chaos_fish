## Game Description

Rally Racer is an exciting top-down 2D racing game built with Pygame. Players control a car and compete against AI opponents on procedurally generated tracks featuring defined roads, grass, mud, and various obstacles. The game emphasizes car handling with features like drifting, handbraking, and dynamic interactions with different surfaces and track elements like ramps and hills.

Players can customize their race by selecting the number of laps, car performance (top speed and grip), the number of checkpoints on the course, the number of AI opponents, and the AI's difficulty level, offering a unique experience each race.

**Key Features:**

* Top-down rally racing action with a focus on car handling.

* Procedurally generated courses including:

  * Defined road paths with improved width consistency.

  * Checkpoints, with options for more complex interactions (future: roundabouts).

  * Challenging off-road elements: grass, mud patches, circular hills, and circular ramps.

  * Obstacle placement logic that avoids cluttering the main road.

* Player-controlled car with detailed physics for:

  * Speed, acceleration, and braking.

  * Drifting and handbrake mechanics.

  * Dynamic jumps with visual lift and shadow effects from ramps and hill crests.

  * Varied grip and speed based on surfaces (road, grass, mud).

* AI-controlled opponent cars with customizable difficulty and randomized performance characteristics.

* Customizable race setup: laps, car performance (top speed/grip), number of checkpoints, AI opponents, and AI difficulty.

* Dynamic particle effects for dust (on grass/dirt) and mud splashes.

* Persistent tire tracks left on grass surfaces for added visual immersion.

* In-game HUD displaying speed, RPM, pedal inputs, lap times (relocated for better visibility), and a mini-map.

* Updated pastel color scheme for a more stylish visual presentation.

* Sound effects for engine, skidding, beeps, etc.

## Recent Gameplay Enhancements (As of May 2025)

* **Procedural Roads:** Tracks now feature a generated road path, offering a primary driving surface.

* **Circular Ramps & Hills:** Ramps and hills are now circular, with hills providing a jump when crested.

* **Surface-Dependent Physics:** Driving on grass significantly reduces speed and grip, while mud is even more penalizing. Roads offer the best grip.

* **Persistent Tire Tracks:** Cars leave lasting tire marks on grassy areas.

* **Visual Overhaul:** Implemented a softer, more stylish pastel color palette across the game.

* **UI Improvements:** Lap timer display has been moved to avoid overlap with the minimap.

* **Enhanced Jump Visuals:** Jumps now feature more pronounced visual lift and dynamic shadow scaling for a better sense of height.
